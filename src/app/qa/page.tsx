    content: "Hey everyone,\nI set up my 20-gallon freshwater tank about a week ago, cycled it with some starter bacteria, and added a few guppies yesterday. This morning, the water is quite cloudy, like a milky white. \n\nWater parameters (API Master Kit):\n- pH: 7.4\n- Ammonia: 0.25 ppm\n- Nitrite: 0 ppm\n- Nitrate: 5 ppm\n\nIs this a bacterial bloom? Should I do a water change or just wait it out? Any advice appreciated!",

        content: "Sounds like a classic bacterial bloom, especially with new fish added. The 0.25 ppm ammonia is likely feeding it. I'd hold off on a large water change unless ammonia spikes higher. It should clear up on its own in a few days to a week as the beneficial bacteria populations stabilize. Keep monitoring ammonia and nitrite!",

Green Star Polyps (GSP) are also super easy and grow fast â€“ just give them their own rock as they can take over. Mushrooms (Discosoma, Rhodactis) are another excellent option.",
